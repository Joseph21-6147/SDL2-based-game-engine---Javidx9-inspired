/* SGE_Draw.h - part of the SDL2-based Game Engine (SGE) v.20221204
 * ================================================================
 *
 * The SGE was developed by Joseph21 and is heavily inspired bij the Pixel Game Engine (PGE) by Javidx9
 * (see: https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine). It's interface is deliberately kept very
 * close to that of the PGE, so that programs can be ported from the one to the other quite easily.

/*
 * The SGE_Draw module implements all the primitives for the SGE. However, I try to keep all user functionality
 * declared from 1 header file, so that the user only has to include 1 file (and all the other SGE code files
 * are included from that file).
 *
 * That is also the reason that this header file is empty: because all declarations of primitive functions are
 * put in the SGE_Core header file.

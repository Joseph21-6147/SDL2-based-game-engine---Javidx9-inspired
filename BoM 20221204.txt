Bill of Materials file for the SDL2-based Game Engine (SGE) v.2021204
=====================================================================

This is the bill of material file with the SDL2-based Game Engine (SGE for short). The SGE was developed by Joseph21 
and is heavily inspired bij the Pixel Game Engine (PGE) by Javidx9. It's interface is deliberately kept very close to 
that of the PGE, so that programs can be ported from the one to the other quite easily.

The SGE is not complete in it's functionality when compared with the PGE. On the other hand, the SGE has some 
features that are not available in the PGE. In particual the ability to work with multiple windows was the main 
reason for me to develop the SGE. 

The following files are part of this package (each header file contains a description of the functionality offered 
from that module):

  SGE_Core.h       & SGE_Core.cpp       - core functions and overridables of the engine
  SGE_Draw.h       & SGE_Draw.cpp       - contains all the drawing primitives of the engine
  SGE_FontData.h   & SGE_FontData.cpp   - offers built in fonts to use with the engine
  SGE_Periferals.h & SGE_Periferals.cpp - functions to query state of keyboard and mouse
  SGE_Pixel.h      & SGE_Pixel.cpp      - pixel definition, operators on pixels, predefined colours
  SGE_Sound.h      & SGE_Sound.cpp      - wrapper around SDL2 sound functionality (music and effects)
  SGE_Sprite.h     & SGE_Sprite.cpp     - sprite and decal classes and lookalikes
  SGE_Timer.h      & SGE_Timer.cpp      - timing and profiling functions (in micro seconds)
  SGE_Utilities.h  & SGE_Utilities.cpp  - contains some global variables and miscellaneous stuff
  SGE_vector_types.h                    - different types of 2D and 3D vector types with operators (incl. homogeneous vectors)
  SGE_Window.h     & SGE_Window.cpp     - class SGE_Window to create and manage multiple windows simultaneously from 
                                          one thread

  main.cpp                              - a test program (courtesy of Javidx9) that shows random pixels on a screen

  licence 20221204.txt                  - description of the license that comes with this software
  BoM 20221204.txt                      - this bill of materials file

Dependencies
  * You need SDL2 installed to run the SGE. This means all header files, libraries and DLL's that come with and/or 
    are needed to compile for SDL2. The engine was developed on SDL2 v 2.0.5;
  * The same holds for SDL_image (v. 2.0.1);
  * The same holds for SDL_Mixer (v. 2.0.4);

If you have any questions, improvements, bug reports, compliments or whatever, please let me know.

Have fun with it!

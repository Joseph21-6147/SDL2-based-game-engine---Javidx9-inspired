# SDL2-based-game-engine

The SGE was developed by Joseph21 and is heavily inspired bij the Pixel Game Engine (PGE) by Javidx9 
(see: https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine). It's interface is deliberately kept very 
close to that of the PGE, so that programs can be ported from the one to the other quite easily.

The SGE is not complete in it's functionality when compared with the PGE. On the other hand, the SGE offers some 
features that are not available in the PGE. In particual the ability to work with multiple windows was the 
main reason for me to develop the SGE. 

This code is completely free to use, change, rewrite or get inspiration from. At the same time, there's no 
warranty that this code is free of bugs. If you use (any part of) this code, you accept each and any risk or 
consequence thereof.

Although there is no obligation to mention or shout out to the creator, he would not mind if you did :)

Have fun with it!
